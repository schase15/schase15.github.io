## A Model to Help Medical Practitioners Predict a Patient's Risk of Mortality
#### *For more effective triaging of patients*

While working in a hospital, there is always a lot of pressure to make prudent decisions. Afterall, the decision you make could be the difference between life and death for your patient. Ideally each patient would receive the full resources of the hospital immediately upon being admitted. However, realistically this is not the case. Hospitals have limited resources and doctors can only be at one place at a time. This requires that a level of urgency is assigned so that more patients can be successfully treated. Those with critical conditions must be seen and treated immediately, while those who can afford to, must wait. In common practice this ranking of urgency is called triage. 

So how do you even begin to triage your patients? Armed with a 2.3 million row dataset sourced from the New York State Health Department, I set out to create an automated model to help practicioners quickly and effectively triage their incoming patients. Utilizing patient information that is available early in the admittance process, my model will return a calculated level of risk of mortality (minor, moderatem major or extreme). Being able to quickly determine their patient's risk of mortality will allow pactitioners to more effectively allocate both the hospital's resources, as well as their own.
