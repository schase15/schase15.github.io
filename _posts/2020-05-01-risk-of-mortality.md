## Model: Predict a Patient's Risk of Mortality
#### *An important metric when triaging patients*
  
*By Steven Chase*

While working in a hospital, there is always a lot of pressure to make prudent decisions. Afterall, the decision you make could be 
the difference between life and death for your patient. Ideally each patient would receive the full resources of the hospital immediately
upon being admitted. However, realistically this is not the case. Hospitals have limited resources and doctors can only be at one place 
at a time. This requires that a level of urgency is assigned to patients so that more patients can be successfully treated. Those with 
critical conditions must be seen and treated immediately, while those who can afford to, must wait. In common practice this ranking of 
urgency is called triage. 

So how do you even begin to triage your patients? I created a model that takes in patient information available early in the
admittance process, and returns a risk of mortality. Quickly being able to classify your patient as having a minor, moderate, major or 
extreme risk of mortality will allow you to more effectively allocate both the hospital's resources, as well as your own.

For more detailed information behind the process, evaluation and insights of the model please read the cooresponding pages on the Dash 
web app.
