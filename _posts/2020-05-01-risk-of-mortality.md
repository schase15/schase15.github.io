## A Model to Help Medical Practitioners Predict a Patient's Risk of Mortality
#### *For more effective triaging of patients*

While working in a hospital, there is always a lot of pressure to make prudent decisions. Afterall, the decision you make could be the difference between life and death for your patient. Ideally each patient would receive the full resources of the hospital immediately upon being admitted. However, realistically this is not the case. Hospitals have limited resources and doctors can only be at one place at a time. This requires that a level of urgency is assigned to patients so that more patients can be successfully treated. Those with critical conditions must be seen and treated immediately, while those who can afford to, must wait. In common practice this ranking of urgency is called triage. 

So how do you even begin to triage your patients? I created a model that utilizes patient information available early in the admittance process, and returns a risk of mortality (minor, moderate, major or extreme). Being able to quickly determine your patient's risk of mortality will allow you to more effectively allocate both the hospital's resources, as well as your own.
